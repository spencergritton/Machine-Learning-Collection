# Machine Learning Collection
This project contains a variety of implementations I've created of popular or interesting machine learning papers. I plan for this collection to serve as both motivation for future learning and a collection of past works which can be re-visited as needed. Though this collection is currently quite modest, I plan to add implementations as time and resources permit and I'm hopeful that this will be possible on a bi-weekly basis for the near future.

# Current Implementations
### Generative Adversarial Networks 
- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/spencergritton/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/main/GANs/GAN)
- [Deep Convolutional (DCGAN)](https://github.com/spencergritton/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/main/GANs/DCGAN)
- [Progressively Growing (ProGAN)](https://github.com/spencergritton/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/main/GANs/ProGAN)
- [Pix2Pix](https://github.com/spencergritton/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/main/GANs/Pix2Pix)

# Planned Future Implementations or Explorations
- StyleGAN
- CycleGAN
- SRGAN (or other super resolution GANs)
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
- YoloV1 - YoloV7
- Fast / Faster R-CNN
- Autoencoders (unsure of specifics)
- Random Forests
- Distributed Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost)
- Deep Dream
- Style Transfer
- Stable Diffusion (Stability.AI)
- Bloom / GPT-3
- BERT
- Image Segmentation (Fast FCN, Gated SCNN, Deep Lab, Mask R-CNN)
- Pose detection (Open Pose, Alpha Pose, etc.)
- Driving Speed Detection (CARLA)
- Transpose Convolution Vs Pixel Shuffle 
- Reinforcement Learning (Need to learn more)
- Open to suggestions


# Notes
- Due to the cost of training deep learning models (monetarily, computationally, and in terms of time commitment) performance of models contained here may be somewhat limited!
- Inspiration for this collection from [Aladdin Persson](https://www.youtube.com/c/AladdinPersson). Some code from early GAN models (GAN and DCGAN) is taken from Aladdin as well.
